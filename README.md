<a>name="transportation</a>
### Transportation 
- Public transportation in The Netherlands is very reliable
- You can schedule your trip at [ns.nl](https://www.ns.nl/en)
- Recommendations: 
  - At Amsterdam Schipol International Airport, train tracks are in the airport hall. You do *not* need to leave the airport building. Buy the ticket in the hall, go downstairs to the tracks, and enjoy the trip!
    ![](./figures/schipol_trains.png)
  - From Amsterdam Schipol International Airport to Maastricht: The trip takes about 2h45'. We recommend to transfer in Utrecht or 'S-Hertogenbosch (not Amsterdam). *Important*: **Sit in the front of the train**. Sometimes (mainly late at night) the train splits in 2 parts in Eindhoven. The head of the train goes to Maastricht, and the tail of the train goes to Venlo. They communicate the split on the train, but it often is only in Dutch
  - From Maastricht train station to The Student Hotel:
    - By bus: Go outside the train station, and find bus terminals on the right. You can buy a ticket on the bus. Several buses go to The Student Hotel and they are very frequent
      ![](./figures/maastricht_buses.png)   
    - On foot: You can walk through downtown and enjoy the athmosphere! 
      ![](./figures/maastricht_walking.png)  
  - How to get to [QMSKI](https://qmski.org/): Take the train from Maastricht to Noordwijk. We recommended to transfers in Eindhoven and Den Haag (not Amsterdam). The trip takes about 3h30'. If you are on a budget, we recommend to book a hotel room in Maastricht for Sat/Sun, and travel on Sunday

<a>name="remibursements</a>
