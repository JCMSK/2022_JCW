### Public transportation 
- Public transportation in The Netherlands is very reliable
- If you travel nationally, you can schedule your trip at [ns.nl](https://www.ns.nl/en)   
- If you travel internationally (e.g. from/to Brussels airport), you can schedule your trip at [nsinternational.com](https://www.nsinternational.com/en)  
- Recommendations: 
  - At Amsterdam Schipol International Airport, train tracks are at the airport hall. You do *not* need to leave the airport building. Buy the ticket in the hall, go downstairs to the tracks, and enjoy the trip!
    
    <img src="./figures/schipol_trains.png" width="700">
    
  - From Amsterdam Schipol International Airport to Maastricht: The trip takes about 2h45'. Consider transfering in Utrecht or 'S-Hertogenbosch (not Amsterdam). *Important*: **Sit in the front of the train**. Sometimes (mainly late at night) the train splits in 2 parts in Eindhoven. The head of the train goes to Maastricht, and the tail of the train goes to Venlo. They communicate the split on the train, but it often is only in Dutch
  - From Maastricht train station to The Student Hotel:
    - By bus: Outside the train station, the bus terminals are on the right. You can buy a ticket on the bus. Several buses go to The Student Hotel and they are very frequent
     
      <img src="./figures/maastricht_buses.png" width="600">
  
    - On foot: You can walk through downtown and enjoy the athmosphere! 
      <img src="./figures/maastricht_walking.png" width="600">
    
  - How to get to [QMSKI](https://qmski.org/): Take the train from Maastricht to Noordwijk. The trip takes about 3h30'. You can plan your trip on [ns.nl](https://www.ns.nl/en) or Google Maps. If you are on a budget, consider booking a hotel room in Maastricht for Sat/Sun, and then travel on Sunday

### Travel reimbursements
- Travel reimbursements are only for participants from European, Middle Eastern, and one International institutions. Apologies to the people who come from other continents. The budget for traveling was limited and the criterion was to reimburse as many people as possible 
- To get a travel reimbursement, there are 2 steps to be done **by June 30, 2022**:       
  1. Send Serena an email with the amount you are requesting and a copy of the expense receipts in **one single .pdf file**       
  2. Fill out the [reimbursement form](https://numfocus.typeform.com/to/ohD1BM). Suggestions for some of the questions:
    - 1 -> Workshop Name:
      *E: Building the Jupyter community in MSK imaging research* 
    - 4 -> Category
      *Travel*
    - 7-12 -> Your institution address
- Reimbursement guidelines: [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BScRQQnMzppkZmmQvdBKyCoum2Rzh9W3q2JgllPU4rI/edit?usp=sharing)
